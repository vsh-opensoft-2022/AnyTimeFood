## Dev Setup

1. Ensure that you have node and yarn installed.
2. Clone the repository. In the project root directory, run the command `yarn` to install the packages. Kindly refrain from using `npm install`.
3. To start the development server, run `yarn serve`. Boom, the live server should start at `http://localhost:3000` and should reload with file changes. Happy Coding âš¡
